Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning Hackclub system made useful by the Hackclub corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\n\nMany computer users run a modified version of the Hackclub system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Hackclub which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Hackclub system, developed by the Hackclub Project.\n\nThere really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Hackclub operating system: the whole system is basically Hackclub with Linux added, or Hackclub/Linux.

Here's a little-known secret though - it's less fun for the sponsors when they get a ton of emails asking for money!\n\nSo, I propose HonorSponsor - A complete solution for hackathon sponsors to avoid dealing with pesky teenagers! HonorSponsor is simple; All sponsors have to do is sign up with their bank account credentials, and HonorSponsor will expose a REST API that organizers can use to request money. As the name implies, it's an honor system - organizers can take whatever they need whenever they need it! With the help of HonorSponsor, both sponsors and organizers can escape the awkwardness of time-consuming sponsorship emails, and everyone can profit!\n\nReady to build the future of hackathon sponsorships?

As a safety feature, ImpostorKit will DM the user you wish to impersonate a request asking for permission, which they will be able to approve or deny. You can allow anyone to impersonate you without asking permission by running /impostorkit alwaysapprove!\n\nAdditionally, ImpostorKit will include :amogus_pov: ImpostorAI - a custom AI that's trained on a sample of messages sent by the person you wish to impersonate! With ImpostorAI, you can be sure that nobody will ever notice that you're an impostor! ImpostorAI will be an opt-in feature - users will have to allow ImpostorAI to be trained on their messages by running /impostorai allow.\n\nIf you're ready to contribute to the :sus: future of the Hack Club Slack, join <#C06672302BH>!
