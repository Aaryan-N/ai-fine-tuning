    "message": ":hammer_and_wrench: PROJECT IDEA :hammer_and_wrench:\n:among_us: ImpostorKit - An all-in-one toolkit for impersonating people on Slack! With ImpostorKit, you can simply run /impostorkit <slack mention> and ImpostorKit will immediately download a copy of your current Slack profile before replacing it with that of the person you wish to impersonate. As a safety feature, ImpostorKit will DM the user you wish to impersonate a request asking for permission, which they will be able to approve or deny. You can allow anyone to impersonate you without asking permission by running /impostorkit alwaysapprove!\n\nAdditionally, ImpostorKit will include :amogus_pov: ImpostorAI - a custom AI that's trained on a sample of messages sent by the person you wish to impersonate! With ImpostorAI, you can be sure that nobody will ever notice that you're an impostor! ImpostorAI will be an opt-in feature - users will have to allow ImpostorAI to be trained on their messages by running /impostorai allow.\n\nIf you're ready to contribute to the :sus: future of the Hack Club Slack, join <#C06672302BH>! ImpostorKit should be ready for production by April 1st, 2024. ImpostorAI should be in Beta by the same date.",
