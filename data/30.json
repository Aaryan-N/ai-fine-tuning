(need help)\nA cloud storage service, but you have to bring your own storage… quite confusing right? so basically, the user has to provide their s3 bucket keys / azure bucket keys and we’ll provide a UI (like google drive) to them. So you can upload / download / share and see stuff in the UI but ultimately, your data is stored in your own aws / azure / digitalocean accounts. What else? You can connect multiple buckets (can be even cross-providers) and you can find all your files in a single place!! (this feature might be limited to pro plan or smth)\nAlso, you don’t have to worry about the keys, they’ll be safely encrypted and stored in the db, so there’s no chance that we can access your files (we’ll only use your keys to fetch your files and show it in the front-end). thoughts??",
